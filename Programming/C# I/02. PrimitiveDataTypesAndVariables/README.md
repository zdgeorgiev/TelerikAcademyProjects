Primitive Data Types and Variables
Tasks discriptions:
01.Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
02.Which of the following values can be assigned to a variable of type float and which to a variable of type double: 34.567839023, 12.345, 8923.1234857, 3456.091?
03.Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers with precision of 0.000001. Examples:(5.3 ; 6.01) -> false; (5.00000001 ; 5.00000003) -> true
04.Declare an integer variable and assign it with the value 254 in hexadecimal format. Use Windows Calculator to find its hexadecimal representation.
05.Declare a character variable and assign it with the symbol that has Unicode code 72. Hint: first use the Windows Calculator to find the hexadecimal representation of 72.
06.Declare a boolean variable called isFemale and assign an appropriate value corresponding to your gender.
07.Declare two string variables and assign them with “Hello” and “World”. Declare an object variable and assign it with the concatenation of the first two variables (mind adding an interval). Declare a third string variable and initialize it with the value of the object variable (you should perform type casting).
08.Declare two string variables and assign them with following value: __ The "use" of quotations causes difficulties. __ Do the above in two different ways: with and without using quoted strings.
09.Write a program that prints an isosceles triangle of 9 copyright symbols ©. Use Windows Character Map to find the Unicode code of the © symbol. Note: the © symbol may be displayed incorrectly.
10.A marketing firm wants to keep record of its employees. Each record would have the following characteristics – first name, family name, age, gender (m or f), ID number, unique employee number (27560000 to 27569999). Declare the variables needed to keep the information for a single employee using appropriate data types and descriptive names.
11.Declare two integer variables and assign them with 5 and 10 and after that exchange their values.
12.Find online more information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a program that prints the entire ASCII table of characters on the console.
13.Create a program that assigns null values to an integer and to double variables. Try to print them on the console, try to add some values or the null literal to them and see the result.
