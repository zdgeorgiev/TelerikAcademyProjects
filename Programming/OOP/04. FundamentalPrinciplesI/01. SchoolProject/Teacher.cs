//We are given a school. In the school there are classes of students. Each class has a set of teachers.
//Each teacher teaches a set of disciplines. Students have name and unique class number.
//Classes have unique text identifier. Teachers have name. Disciplines have name, number of lectures and number of exercises.
//Both teachers and students are people. Students, classes, teachers and disciplines
//could have optional comments (free text block).
//Your task is to identify the classes (in terms of  OOP) and their
//attributes and operations, encapsulate their fields, define the class
// hierarchy and create a class diagram with Visual Studio.
